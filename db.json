        "title": "Thailand Costs",
        "content": "Accommodation \r\n\r\nThailand is very cheap, though the north is far cheaper than Bangkok and the southern islands. You can find cheap guesthouses for as little 300 THB per night in cities and 200 THB per night in the countryside, though in the big cities like Chiang Mai and Bangkok, rooms start at about 400 per night. On the islands or for a nicer room with air-conditioner, expect to pay 600 THB and up per night. Basic bungalows cost the same. Hotels start at around 1,350 THB per night and go up from there. Big resorts on the islands start at 1,700 THB per night for a bungalow on the beach. Dorm rooms, which are increasingly widespread throughout the country, range from 100-150 THB per night. Airbnb is also growing in Thailand and a good amount of cities have a nice selection. A shared room starts around 350 THB per night and renting a full apartment starts around 700 THB per night. Chada Guesthouse (Bangkok), Julies (Chiang Mai), Kodchasri B&amp;B (Chiang Mai), Pooh&rsquo;s (Ko Lipe), Greenhouse (Khao Yai) are my favorite places to sleep in the country. \r\n\r\nFood \r\nFood is really cheap in Thailand. Street food costs as little as 20 THB, though on average you&rsquo;ll spend about 35-50 THB per meal if you want something really filling. If you stick to the local street food, you can eat for around 120-170 THB a day. Most western dishes (burgers, pizza, pasta, etc) cost between 170-340 THB, though they can be higher in the fancier western establishments. Since food is so cheap, there&rsquo;s no point in grocery shopping unless you&rsquo;re looking to get some pre-made salads or fruits. Visit each city guide for specific food recommendations in each place! \r\n\r\nTransportation \r\n\r\nLike everything in Thailand, transportation is also cheap. Local buses cost as little as 8 THB per trip, the Metro and Skytrain in Bangkok cost 15-50 THB per trip and metered taxi rides are usually 60-100 THB each. Tuk-tuks are un-metered and generally more expensive, costing 100-235 THB per ride. Motorbike taxis (in orange vests) are available all over the country with short trips costing about 35 THB (you need to negotiate the price). Train service around the country is cheap &ndash; day trains cost as little as 50 THB. Night trains start at 575 THB for second-class without air-conditioning. Boats to/from the islands cost between 250-475 THB. (Note: It&rsquo;s often better to get a bus/boat package then pay for them separately.) Coach buses are a great way to get around the country. For example, a bus ride from Bangkok to Chiang Mai costs 550-700 THB and a bus ride from Bangkok to Phuket costs 500-1,000 THB. Activities Day tours cost 500-1,200 THB depending on the activity. Jungle trekking costs 1,000-1,685 THB per day. Keep in mind, you have more bargaining power if you go with a group. Most parks and national museums cost between 50-100 THB to get into (as a non-Thai, you&rsquo;ll always pay a higher rate). A PADI dive certification course (very popular in Thailand) costs around 10,000 THB (but often includes accommodation).\r\n\r\n Source: https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/thailand-travel-tips/\"</p>",

        "title": "Top Things to See and Do in Thailand",
        "content": "There\u2019s a reason that Thailand is so popular with backpackers. In fact, there are many! As well as white sand beaches, clear blue oceans and stunning hostels, the country offers off-the-beaten-track budget travel experiences and an epic party scene. \r\n\r\nThere\u2019s just one problem \u2013 it\u2019s too easy to accidentally spend your whole trip chilling in a hammock on the beach! We\u2019re here to help you out of that hammock by letting you in on 11 ridiculously cool things to do in Thailand.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo matter what time of year you visit, and no matter how many times you have been, Thailand is always a good idea!\r\n\r\n1. Enjoy An Ethical Elephant Experience In Chiang Mai\r\nThings to Do in Thailand - Ethical Elephant Experience In Chiang Mai\r\n\r\n\r\nAsk anyone what to do in Thailand and you\u2019ll always get the same answer: Elephants! But it\u2019s really important to do your research beforehand to avoid places that exploit and mistreat the animals. For an unforgettable ethical elephant experience, head to the Elephant Rescue Park in Chiang Mai, where mistreated Dumbos are rescued and retired. It\u2019s forbidden to ride the elephants here of course, but you can feed them, bathe them and even take a nice walk with your new big-eared pals. The tour begins with a trip to the elephant poo park, where you\u2019ll learn how their dung is recycled into paper, trust us \u2013 it\u2019s the shit! For more tips on travelling ethically, read our guide to how to be a responsible tourist whilst travelling through Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Chill Out On Koh Nang Yuan Island\r\n\r\nKoh Nang Yuan is no ordinary island, oh no my friends! Koh Nang Yuan is the answer to all of your tropical, jungle-covered, sand-strip island dreams! Two gorgeous mountainous mini islands are connected by the stunning Nangyuan Island beach, accessible by a private boat from Koh Tao. The Island Viewpoint is a must and offers you the most breathtaking views over the fairytale islands and irresistible turquoise waters. We are officially obsessed!\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Pump up the party with Slip n Fly in Koh Phangan\r\n\r\nDid we just lose all credibility by saying \u2018pump up the party?\u2019 No? Ok, good. Anyways, Koh Phangan Island is known for its riotous nightlife *cough* and full moon parties *cough*. Slip n Fly brings a taste of this famous nightlife into the daytime and is one of the best things to do in Thailand for thrill-seekers. Picture a huge water park with a body-boarding slide, splash pool, beer pong tables and the main attraction: the deep pool slide. This 30 foot water slide will launch you into the air like some sort of feather-less eagle, before you plummet downwards with a splash\u2026 just try your best not to belly flop!\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Watch The Sunrise Over Chiang Mai From A Hot Air Balloon\r\n\r\nWatching the sunrise is great. Watching the sunrise as you glide blissfully through the skies of Chiang Mai in a hot air balloon is downright glorious. Chiang Mai is wonderful from any perspective, but floating above the mountainous city as the sun begins to tickle the breathtaking temples below is, well, quite poetic really! Choose a group or private balloon and let the engine fire keep you toasty warm while you bask in the calming early morning glow. The tour starts at 6am and lasts about an hour \u2013 trust us, it\u2019s worth getting up for.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.  Discover Koh Phangan\u2019s Secret Mountain\r\n\r\nLife\u2019s more fun when you stray from the path, and the Secret Mountain in Koh Phangan proves this perfectly. To discover this hidden gem you\u2019ll need to navigate the steep and winding roads along the mountainside \u2013 we recommend leaving your scooter at home! Once you reach the top you\u2019ll be met with an insane pool and funky restaurant bar. Oh\u2026 and an incredible view over Koh Phangan\u2019s lush forests stretching for miles before you. The best bit is that this little treasure is totally free to visit, meaning you only have to fork out for food and drinks. You\u2019re welcome!\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Snorkel Your Way Around Koh Tao\r\n\r\nSnorkelling is the cheapest way to enjoy the famous underwater delights of Koh Tao. Tours are relatively cheap, but if you\u2019re on a really tight budget it\u2019s possible to buy or borrow a cheap snorkel and go it alone \u2013 just be sure to check weather and sea conditions beforehand, and let somebody know where you\u2019re going and when you\u2019ll be back. Be sure to visit the exceptionally beautiful Lighthouse and Mango Bays, where you\u2019ll be treated to schools of rainbow fish and crystal-clear waters. Always chat to locals and hostel staff before setting off for advice on must-sees as well as must avoids in your area\u2026 \r\n\r\n7. Go On A Thailand Temple Crawl\r\n\r\nWith over 40 thousand temples in Thailand, it can be hard to pick the best. But we\u2019ll try, since you asked so nicely! One of our favourite all-rounders is Doi Suthep Temple in Chiang Mai. This shiny golden stunner is located on top of a mountain, and is surrounded by practising monks in brightly coloured robes and the intense smell of burning incense \u2013 Doi Suthep really is a treat for the senses. One of Thailand\u2019s most iconic temples that is a must-see despite the crowds is Wat Phra Yai in Koh Sumui. The temple features an impressove Buddha statue sat at the top of a long flight of steps. At 12 meters high, this giant golden beauty is a sight to behold and definitely one of the best things to do in Thailand \u2013 just try to get there early to avoid the crowds.\r\n\r\n8. Make A Splash At Songkran Festival\r\n\r\nSongkran Festival is a part of Thailand\u2019s New Year\u2019s celebrations, and is considered the biggest water fight in the world. Thai New Year is in mid-April so if you\u2019re lucky enough to be visiting at this time you\u2019d be mad not to make a splash in this high energy and exciting tradition. Locals, tourists, travellers and everyone in between take to the streets armed with water guns, bottles, hoses, and buckets ready to soak as many people as possible!\r\n\r\n9. Jump into Chiang Mai\u2019s Waterpark and Grand Canyon\r\n\r\nThe Canyon at Chiang Mai is man made, and MAN they made it well! Get your adrenaline fix diving from the dramatic red-brown cliffs or speeding along the zip line, before releasing your inner child on the inflatable obstacle course and slides. The water park has its own restaurant serving up freaky freakshakes to give you the ultimate sugar rush, but remember kiddies: try to wait an hour before getting back in the water!\r\n\r\n10. Stroll through Chatuchak Weekend Market In Bangkok\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a fact (probably) that Bangkok has some of the best markets in the world. But the coolest and most iconic is Chatuchak Weekend Market, so if you only have time for one, make sure it\u2019s this one. Boasting over 15,000 mini stalls, you can buy just about anything at Chatuchak. Traditional Thai food, live animals, vintage clothing, and handmade art are just part of the large array of treasures on sale here. This is a fab opportunity to refresh your wardrobe on a budget with the coolest wavy garms. Check out our guide to the best markets in Bangkok for more inspo.\r\n\r\n11. Scuba Dive In Koh Tao\r\n\r\nIf you want to step up your underwater game in Koh Tao beyond the snorkeling, then this is the perfect place to bag your paid license. With brightly colored-coral, tropical fish and unbelievably-clear waters, this is one of the coolest places to learn to scuba dive in Thailand. You\u2019ll even have a professional underwater photographer on hand to take the perfect picture for your Instagram/mum. Taking a scuba diving course is also a great way for solo travelers to meet other travelers, as it\u2019s a fun and social experience that will help you make friends fast.\r\n\r\nSource: https://www.hostelworld.com/blog/worlds-best-backpacker-destinations/",

        "title": "When is the best time to visit Thailand?",
        "content": "The best time to visit Thailand depends exactly on where you're going. The islands on one side of the country have a slightly different rainy season to those on the other; the good news is that this extends Thailand's dry, sunny season. So if it's rainy and grey in one place, it's a short hop over the coast to sunshine on the other side.\r\n\r\nBasically, December to March are the best months to go to Thailand - though as with any tropical destination, a short and ridiculously torrential burst of rain is unpredictably possible, even on the sunniest of days.\r\n\r\nThe Thai islands in the Gulf of Thailand - Koh Samui, Koh Phangan, Koh Tao - tend to get less rain than the rest of the country (even in rainy season), and are at their best from the end of January until mid-March. January is the freshest month - great for after the Christmas and NYE party chaos. February is the driest month, one of the sunniest, and the heat still bearable; and March is sunny and dry, too.\r\n\r\nOver on Thailand's west coast and the Andaman Sea - where you'll find the Thai islands of Phuket, Krabi, Koh Lanta, Koh Phi Phi -the optimum time for a beach holiday is slightly earlier, in December and January, when fresher weather, maximum sunshine and minimum rainfall combine to create the best climate for a beach holiday.\r\n\r\nBangkok, meanwhile, is stultifyingly humid practically all the time (discomfort levels range from 'high' to 'extreme' year-round), but the best time to visit Thailand's capital is December and January, when it is dry and a relatively bearable 31-32\u00baC average during the day, and 20\u00baC at night (the coolest Bangkok ever gets). When not to go to Bangkok: avoid the months of April and September. April is unbearably hot and humid; September is hot, humid and torrentially wet.\r\n\r\nChiang Mai and the lovely little town of Pai, in Thailand's cooler north, have much more pleasant climates than Bangkok and the south. Go from December to February for lovely sunny days (around 29\u00baC) and cooler evenings (the temperature dips to 13\u00baC - and even lower in the highlands, so dig out some warm clothes if you're trekking).\r\n\r\nThe time to not go to Thailand is the rainy season, from May to October, when monsoons blow in from all directions.\r\n\r\nSource: http://www.cntraveller.com/article/best-time-to-visit-thailand",

        "title": "10 Best Islands in Thailand",
        "content": "Each island is distinct from the next. There are dozens to choose from Here, Nell McShane Wulfhart selects one for every occasion, whether you want to party til dawn, learn to dive, eat the best Thai food or escape from the world on a secluded, romantic break.\r\n\r\n\r\nKOH PHI PHI\r\nBest Thai island for: Solo and single travellers\r\nIf you're going on holiday on your own or with single friends then Koh Phi Phi might just be the island for you. In recent years it has been almost entirely rebuilt after the tsunami devastated it, with smarter places to stay than ever. With a reputation for good times and lots of activities on offer (diving, snorkelling, cliff-jumping, boat trips to Koh Phi Phi Ley (pictured), among other islets, where The Beach was filmed), Koh Phi Phi draws a young, stylish, energetic crowd with a degree of sophistication, ready to relax or to party (though not the hardcore ravers of Pha Ngan), particularly on New Year's Eve.\r\n\r\nKOH LANTA\r\nBEST FOR: when you can't make up your mind\r\nOf all Thailand's islands, Koh Lanta is one of the best all-rounders. Less than an hour's boat ride from Krabi, Koh Lanta is actually made up of several little islands, the most-visited of which is Koh Lanta Yai. It has nature reserves and beaches where you won't see another soul; it's got accommodation that runs the gamut from spare to super-swanky, which attract more 30-, 40- and 50-something travellers than backpackers. Bringing the children? The waters are calm and the island safe.\r\n\r\n\r\nKOH CHANG, THAILAND\r\nBest for exploring Thailand's eastern islands\r\nMore shy and retiring than big sisters Phuket and Samui, Koh Chang is Thailand in miniature. It's not exactly untouched, but much of its interior is national park, great for jungle trekking, and you can easily get from here to the smaller, secluded islands of the archipelago. It's also getting popular with those who want to hop over to Siem Reap after a week in Thailand. Avoid the main west-coast beaches: head to the blink-and-you'll-miss-it Had Sai Noi Beach for its bohemian beach-bar scene, and visit Salakkok Bay for a rare glimpse of a traditional fishing village (fast disappearing elsewhere) and to kayak through the mangroves. Locals really rate the family-run Kati restaurant in Klong Prao village, where everything is made to order using homemade curry pastes (there's an adjoining cookery school if you want to swot up on the recipes).\r\n\r\nKOH LIPE\r\nBEST FOR: Hopeless romantics and honeymooners\r\nWhen you picture a Thai island, you're probably thinking of somewhere like Koh Lipe. Often said to have the most beautiful beaches in Thailand, Koh Lipe is one of the 51 islands that make up Tarutao Marine Park, down south near the border of Malaysia. It's got the dreamy combination of remoteness (far fewer tourists than Phuket or Samui), picture-perfect beaches and luxury hotels.\r\n\r\nThe island is small enough to explore on foot, perhaps hand-in-hand with your loved one. Pattaya Beach (pictured) is the busiest of the beaches and home to most of the island's nightlife, while Sunset Beach is the quietest and most secluded. Snorkelling, diving and tours of nearby islets are readily available, although you might prefer to spend your time getting couples' massages at one of the exclusive resorts.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIMILAN ISLANDS\r\nBest for: island-hopping\r\nImagine Koh Phi Phi Ley before The Beach - only smaller, harder to get to, more beautiful. Now imagine a dreamy chain of nine of these little wonders. Nine! The Similan Islands are numbered north to south, one to nine, and form a national park in the Andaman Sea. You can swim over untouched coral reefs in the turquoise waters off them all, but only step foot on the white-sand beaches of Koh Miang (known as 'number four'), which has simple bamboo bungalows, and the largest island Koh Similan (number eight). Just north of the national park, Koh Tachai has the softest, sparkliest sand and is the most popular. Close to the Burmese border, Richelieu Rock is one of the world's best dive sites and whale shark territory (February-April is the best time to spot them). Wherever you go, you'll need a boat. Khao Lak, an hour's drive north of Phuket, is the jump-off point for day trips and live-aboards sailing around the islands. The town itself is simply a cluster of restaurants (QCumber is a must for healthy breakfasts and Thai curries) and guesthouses set back from the beach. (The Similan Islands are closed to tourists May-October.)\r\n\r\n\r\nKOH SAMUI\r\nBest Thai island for: Families and first-timers, honeymooners and yoga bunnies\r\nKoh Samui is the original Thai island. Where once it drew backpackers and ravers for its sensational beaches with cheap huts and full-moon parties; now it has grown up and smartened up, its not-so-rustic beach bungalows honed down to the very last detail - Koh Samui now has some of the best luxury beach resorts anywhere in the world, several excellent beach hotels, and some first-class spas.\r\n\r\nAll of which makes it ideal for those who want the joy of a beach holiday in Thailand without any of the roughness around the edges. Honeymooners can take their pick of super-luxe hotels, beach clubs and Michelin-starred restaurants; parents can go for family-friendly hotels with childcare and splash pools and Western food (there's even a branch of Boots); nervous first-timers can make their first foray into South-East Asia surrounded by home comforts and limited creepy-crawlies.\r\n\r\nKOH PHA NGAN\r\nBest Thai island for: Hedonists and hippies\r\nIf your idea of the perfect holiday involves three-day beach parties, Koh Phangan is the Thai island for you. Famous for its full moon parties at Haad Rin's Sunrise Beach (pictured), this island is for hardcore partygoers and dreadlocked travellers. During peak season, the island can see 20,000 visitors dancing, drinking and cavorting on the white sands under the full moon. If you can't make it at the right time of month, don't worry - there are half-moon and black-moon parties in intervening weeks, and there's action every night of the week at the island's beach and cocktail bars.\r\n\r\n\r\nKOH TAO\r\nBest for: Scuba diving\r\nThe coast of Koh Tao, or 'Turtle Island', is lined with little sandy coves, pretty lantern-lit restaurants - and dive shops. Most travellers are here to dive. The island is one of the world's top places to learn, and the competition among dive shops has also made it one of the cheapest. If you're new to the sport, sign up to get your PADI or SSI Open Water certification. This usually takes four days, and includes four ocean dives. If you're already certified, you can take advanced courses in diving at night diving, wreck diving, shark diving or Nitrox diving, or just jump on any of the tens of boats heading out every day. Phoenix Divers has been around since 2002 and is one of the top shops on Koh Tao. Instructors teach in a variety of languages and children's courses are also available.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHUKET, THAILAND\r\nBest for: Living large\r\nGlitzy Phuket offers every Western convenience you can think of, and probably several you can't. Celebrity-chef restaurants? Check. Six-star resorts with private butlers? Check. World-class plastic surgery? No problem. If you're the highest of high-maintenance, Phuket is the island for you.\r\n\r\nPhuket is the biggest, busiest island in Thailand, and although it has been infiltrated by package holidays and cheap sleaze in a few places (avoid Bangla Road in Patong), it also has cosmopolitan diversions in the form of designer boutiques and world-class restaurants - one of the best of which is Acqua.\r\n\r\n\r\nKOH SI CHANG, THAILAND\r\nBest for: Bangkok's nearest beach for flying visits\r\nIf you're only in Thailand for a few days, schlepping all the way out from Bangkok to distant islands might not be possible. Instead, grab a day or two on Koh Si Chang (not to be confused with Koh Chang), a two-hour boat ride from the city, making it one of the Bangkok's closest beach destinations. It is popular with Bangkok residents who head here for weekend breaks, and even day trips.\r\n\r\n\r\nSource: http://www.cntraveller.com/gallery/thailand-islands-guide",
